### Image Uploader 
This is a full-stack image uploader project that allows users to upload an image from a React Native mobile app. The image is stored on a Node.js backend with PostgreSQL as the database. The uploaded image is then made visible on a React web app.

# Project Structure
- React Native App: Mobile app where users can select and upload images from their device.
- Node.js Backend: RESTful API to handle image uploads and store image metadata in PostgreSQL.
- PostgreSQL Database: Stores the image metadata such as filename, file path, and upload timestamp.
- React Web App: Displays the uploaded images fetched from the Node.js backend.
